# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13 Challenge repository for mapping earthquakes and tectonic plates using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data.

The images below illustrate the following activities performed:
1.  Addition of tectonic plate data as another layer that can be toggled on or off (toggled on as default).  The tectonic plates have been styled with heavier weighted orange lines.
2.  Addition of popup markers for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
3.  Addition of a third map style that displays a dark map

Note:  All module 13 chapter work was performed in a separate repository to keep the challenge repository focused.  And because a valid API key is required, this webpage has not been published to github pages for viewing.
